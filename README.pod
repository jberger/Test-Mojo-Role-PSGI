=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Test::Mojo> makes testing L<Mojolicious> applications easy and fun.
Wouldn't it be nice if there was some way to use it for non-Mojolicious apps?
L<Test::Mojo::Role::PSGI> does just that.

The author suggests using L<Test::Mojo::WithRoles> to make instances of the tester with (possibly multiple) roles applied in a sane way.

=head1 OVERRIDES

=head2 new

Overrides the L<Test::Mojo/new> method to use a PSGI app, instantiating a script or class if necessary.
This should feel very similar to the original behavior except that now PSGI apps are the target, rather than Mojolicious apps.

Acceptable arguments are strings that can be used by L<Plack::Util/load_psgi> or else instantated PSGI applications, including bare code references.
